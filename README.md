# Sentiment Analysis on different types of texts

In this project, I have implemented a sentiment analyzer that is able to classify different types of input text (tweets, movie reviews, sentences).


## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/leyresv/Sentiment_Analysis.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To try the classifier on your own data, open a terminal prompt on the root directory and introduce the following command:
```bash
python main/main.py
```

## Models

[Here](models) you can find the different models and the code to train them.

### Tweets classifier

The tweets classifier has been trained using the *Twitter Samples* dataset from NLTK. 
I have extracted the positive and negative frequencies of the words on each tweet and used them as features to train three different classification models using
a Logistic Regression, a Na√Øve Bayes and a Support Vector Machine algorithms. I only keep the best performing one, which is the Logistic Regression classifier,
with an accuracy of 0.997 on the test set.

## Visualization

[Here](notebooks) you can find some notebooks explaining the training process for each classifier.
